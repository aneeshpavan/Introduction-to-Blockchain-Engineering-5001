Avalanche effect: \n","\n","Answer:\n","\n","The function hash = input modulo 1000 cannot be used as a cryptographic hash function because it lacks several important properties required for secure hashing:\n","\n","1.   Ease of computation: The modulo operator is a simple mathematical process that can be done quickly. This makes it subject to brute force attacks, where an attacker can easily make a large number of input values and quickly figure out their hash values.\n","\n","\n","2.   Compression: The hash function should accept inputs of any length and return outputs of a set length. In this case, there are only 1000 possible numbers for the output, so many different inputs will lead to the same hash value. Because it doesn't compress, it can't be used in security.\n","\n","\n","3.   Preimage resistance: If you have a hash value, you shouldn't be able to find an input that makes that hash value. In this case, there are only 1000 possible output values, so an attacker can just try all possible inputs until they find one that gives the desired hash value. This means that the function can't be fooled by a previous picture.\n","\n","\n","4.   2nd preimage resistance: If you give it an input, you shouldn't be able to find another input that gives you the same hash number. In this case, there are only 1000 possible numbers for the input, so an attacker can just try all of them until they find one that gives the same hash value. This means that the code can't handle a second copy of itself.\n","\n","\n","5.   Collision resistance: It shouldn't be possible to find two different inputs that give the same hash value using computers. Since there are only 1000 possible values for the output in this case, there are only 1000 different inputs that can give unique hash values. This means that it is pretty easy for an attacker to find collisions by trying different input values until they find two that give the same hash value.\n","\n","\n","6.   Avalanche effect: The hash function should have the avalanche effect, where a small change in the input should cause a big change in the output. Since there are only 1000 possible numbers for the output in this case, a small change to the input will have a very small effect on the output. This means that the function doesn't have the avalanche effect.\n","\n","In conclusion, the function hash = input modulo 1000 can't be used as a cryptographic hash function because it doesn't have any security features."],"metadata":{"id":"bsvNDIq-yFF6"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n","\n","---\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"gNtCeceQ1hsZ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Problem 5  [15pts]:\n","pymerkle is a convenience python library for merkle tree.\n","https://pymerkle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#\n","Using this library (choose SHA256 as hash algorithm), write a code to:\n","1.
