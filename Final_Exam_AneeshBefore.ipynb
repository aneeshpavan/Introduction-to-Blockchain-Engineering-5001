Ease of computation: The modulo operator is a simple mathematical operation that can be computed quickly. This makes it vulnerable to brute force attacks, where an attacker can easily generate a large number of input values and quickly compute their corresponding hash values.\n","\n","2.   Compression: The hash function should be able to take in inputs of arbitrary length and return a fixed-length output. In this case, the output is limited to 1000 possible values, which means that many different inputs will result in the same hash value. This lack of compression makes it unsuitable for use in cryptography.\n","\n","3.   Preimage resistance: Given a hash value, it should be computationally infeasible to find an input that produces that hash value. In this case, since there are only 1000 possible output values, an attacker can simply try all possible inputs until they find one that produces the desired hash value. This means that the function is not preimage resistant.\n","\n","4.   2nd preimage resistance: Given an input, it should be computationally infeasible to find another input that produces the same hash value. In this case, since the input is limited to 1000 possible values, an attacker can simply try all possible inputs until they find another one that produces the same hash value. This means that the function is not 2nd preimage resistant.\n","\n","5.   Collision resistance: It should be computationally infeasible to find two different inputs that produce the same hash value. In this case, since the output is limited to 1000 possible values, there are only 1000 different input values that can produce unique hash values. This means that it is relatively easy for an attacker to find collisions by trying different input values until they find two that produce the same hash value.\n","\n","6.   Avalanche effect: The hash function should exhibit the avalanche effect, where a small change in the input should result in a significant change in the output. In this case, since the output is limited to 1000 possible values, changing the input by a small amount will result in a very small change in the output. This means that the function does not exhibit the avalanche effect.\n","\n","In conclusion, the function hash = input modulo 1000 cannot be used as a cryptographic hash function due to its lack of security properties."],"metadata":{"id":"qcPwS7dgZYYh"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Problem 5  [15pts]:\n","pymerkle is a convenience python library for merkle tree.\n","https://pymerkle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#\n","Using this library (choose SHA256 as hash algorithm), write a code to:\n","1.
